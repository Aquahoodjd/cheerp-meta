<h1>Cheerp Hello World</h1>

Open the JavaScript console (F12) and hopefully you will see 'Hello, world!'.

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

If there was a network error fetching <code>hello.wasm</code>, it's likely that you opened this HTML file directly from your filesystem. You must run an actual HTTP server instead and view the page from there.
